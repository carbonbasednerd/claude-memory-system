# Global User Preferences

## Current Work

(No active sessions)

## Instructions for Claude

When starting a new session:
1. Greet the user briefly and welcome them back
2. Summarize the active sessions shown in the "Current Work" section above (task names and key files being modified)
3. Ask if they want to continue working on one of those tasks or start something new

Be concise but friendly. If there are no active sessions, just greet them and ask what they'd like to work on.
